# Cybernet / Elite Bionic Framework

Add EBF Hediffs to Cybernet limbs.

That's it, that's the mod.

Cybernet offers a really interesting twist on the usual modded Rimworld Bionics grind, and thought it would benefit from the EBF hp boosts that many other bionics mods have adopted.

"Bionics" tier limbs get a 25% hp boost. "Advanced Bionics" get 50%.

Body parts added by Cybernet that (as far as I know) cannot be damaged, such as skin/blood/nervous system, have not been changed.
